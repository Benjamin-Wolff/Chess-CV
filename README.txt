Project: Chess Board Image Analyzer

Project Description:  My project is related to processing images of chess boards with pieces, involving processing them and providing chess-related insights based on the chess position. 
                        My project includes the following steps: 
                         (1) Processing image to determine locations of each square of chess board
                         (2) Determine if each square is empty, what piece and color may be there
                         (3) Provide chess-related insights to the user

The main file is chessCV. I compiled the code with a makefile, and ran it with something like: ./chessCV img *PATH_TO_IMAGE*
    While in use, I would press various buttons for different steps, which is available to see in my code. The main one is to press 'x' to run everything and provide analysis of the chess position.
